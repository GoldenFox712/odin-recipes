    <h2>Quick Filipino Style Adobo</h2>

      <p>This is a simplified and carb free version of a Filipino dish. There's nothing wrong with the original, but for those of use who need something quick and easy, but still carb free, this recipe will offer a tasty solution.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, this is a fairly simple recipe. Let's dive in!</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
      <p>We only need a few basic things to get started. I would suggest using pork belly if you can find it, but if not, pork shoulder blade steak is a common thing to find in American grocery stores and is a tender, juicy alternative.</p>
      <p>We're going to need pork (you could use chicken instead), soy sauce and wine vinegar. A fresh lime is optional. To recap, those ingredients are;</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Pork belly (or appropriate substitute)</li>
        <li>Skillet, preferably non-stick</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <li>Wine vinegar (white or red)</li>
        <li>Fresh lime/juice (optional)</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Cut up meat into bite size chunks.</li>
        <li>Place meat into pan and put on medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add just a few (2-4) spashes of soy sauce, depending on how much meat you're using. Don't use too much, as it is really salty.</li>
        <li>Add 1 or 2 splashes of vinegar (you want 1 part vinegar to 2 parts soy sauce)</li>
        <li>(Optional) Add a few squirts of lime juice.</li>
        <li>Stir the meat around in the pan to ensure every piece soaks up some of the flavor.</li>
        <li>Let it cook thoroughly over medium heat.</li>
      </ol>
