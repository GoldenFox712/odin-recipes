     <h2>Cooking that perfect steak</h2>
      <p>Cooking a tender, juicy steak is easier than you might think. I've been cooking tender steaks with this method consistently for years. We don't need any fancy marinades or special tactics.</p>
      <p>The list of things you need is actually quite small. Let's get started!</p>
     
     <h4>Ingredients</h4>
      <p>Before we list the ingredients, let's talk about what kind of steak you should use. Typically ribeye, t-bone, porterhouse or strip steak are going to be the most tender. Acquire one of those and you'll be all set!</p>
      <p>How well done you cook the steak will also greatly determine how tender and juicy it is. You can buy an expensive ribeye, but if you cook it for too long it will lose its fat and juices and end up tough. You want to aim between medium and medium rare when cooking. We'll go more in depth in the steps below on how to do this.</p>
      <p>Once you have your steak, we're going to need a good amount of butter to cook it in. We'll need a pan of course, preferrably a cast iron skillet (this compliments the steak flavor very well). I recommend only using salt on your first cooked steak to get a baseline for what you like or don't like. Salt is really all you need!</p>

    <h5>Ingredient recap;</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Steak (ribeye, t-bone, porterhouse or strip steak)</li>
        <li>Pan (preferrably cast iron skillet)</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Salt (good quality pink salt works the best for me)</li>
        <li>Other preferred seasonings (black pepper, garlic and onion powder work well)</li>
      </ul>
     
     <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Take your steak of choice out of the package and sprinkle your preferred amount of salt and seasonings on. Let it sit while you prepare the pan.</li>
        <li>Grab your pan and put a generous amount of butter in. We want the steak to sit in the butter the whole time it's coooking.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat on medium-high and let the butter melt. <strong>This is a crucial point;</strong> let the butter get hot enough to the point that it's almost smoking. You want the pan nice and hot before you put your steak in.</li>
        <li>Put the steak in the pan, leave the heat on medium-high. <strong>This is another crucial step; </strong>Grab a timer and set it for how well done you want your steak. You should aim somehwere between medium rare and medium if you want a tender, juicy steak. Anything more than that and you will almost certainly end up with a dry, tough steak. I'll list the times per side in the next step.</li>
        <li>(These times are per side. Only flip the steak once.) 
            <ul>
                <li>1 minute for seared only</li>
                <li>2 minutes for rare</li>
                <li>2:30 minutes for medium rare</li>
                <li>3:30 minutes for medium</li>
                <li>4:30 minutes for done</li>
                <li>5+ minutes for well done</li>

            </ul></li>
        <li>Once the timer is up, remove from the steak from the pan. It's not necessary to let the steak sit, I find this does not improve the tenderness. Simply let it cool, grab your knife and fork and enjoy! Pour some fresh melted butter over it for more flavor effect.</li>

      </ol>
