     <h2>Cooking that perfect steak</h2>
      <p>Cooking a tender, juicy steak is easier than you might think. I've been cooking tender steaks with this method consistently for years. We don't need any fancy marinades or special tactics.</p>
      <p>The list of things you need is actually quite small. Let's get started!</p>
     
     <h4>Ingredients</h4>
      <p>Before we list the ingredients, let's talk about what kind of steak you should use. Typically ribeye, t-bone, porterhouse or strip steak are going to be the most tender. Acquire one of those and you'll be all set!</p>
      <p>Once you have your steak, we're going to need a good amount of butter to cook it in. We'll need a pan of course, preferrably a cast iron skillet (this compliments the steak flavor very well). I recommend only using salt on your first cooked steak to get a baseline for what you like or don't like. Salt is really all you need!</p>

    <h5>Ingredient recap;</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Steak (ribeye, t-bone, porterhouse or strip steak)</li>
        <li>Pan (preferrably cast iron skillet)</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Salt (good quality pink salt works the best for me)</li>
      </ul>
     
     <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Take your steak of choice out of the package and sprinkle your preferred amount of salt on. Let it sit while you prepare the pan.</li>
        <li>Grab your pan and put a generous amount of butter in. We want the steak to sit in the butter the whole time it's coooking.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat on medium-high and let the butter melt. <strong>This is a crucial point;</strong> let the butter get hot enough to the point that it's almost smoking. You want the pan nice and hot before you put your steak in.</li>
      </ol>
